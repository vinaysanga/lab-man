- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `lab-man`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `14bM4n25`

Example connection string: `postgres://postgres:14bM4n25@localhost:5432/lab-man`

### Debugging

The project is configured for VS Code debugging. To debug the application:

1. Start the application in debug mode (it's already configured in [compose.dev.yml](./compose.dev.yml) and a VS Code launch configuration is already defined at [launch.json](./.vscode/launch.json)
2. In VS Code:
   - Set your breakpoints
   - Go to Run and Debug (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D)
   - Select "Docker: Attach to Node" from the dropdown.
3. The debugger should automatically attach to the running container and will stop at your breakpoints.
